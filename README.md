# welcome to my page about my journey in building a programme
 just indicate that I have cut out some of the commands normal output for brevities sake,A command line, or terminal, is a text based interface to the system. You are able to enter commands by typing them on the keyboard and feedback will be given to you similarly as text.

 *The command line typically presents you with a prompt. As you type, it will be displayed after the prompt.
 The terminal may seem daunting but don't fret. Linux is full of shortcuts to help make your life easier. You'll be introduced to several of them throughout this tutorial. Take note of them as not only do they make your life easier, they often also save you from making silly mistakes such as typos.*Here's your first shortcut. When you enter commands, they are actually stored in a history. You can traverse this history using the up and down arrow keys. So don't bother re-typing out commands you have previously entered, you can usually just hit the up arrow a few times. You can also edit these commands using the left and right arrow keys to move the cursor where you want.*
