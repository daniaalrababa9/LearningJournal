1. ACCESS CONTENT : You can use JavaScript to select any
element, attribute, or text 
1. MODIFY CONTENT : You can use JavaScript to add
elements, attributes, and text to the
page, or remove them. 
1. PROGRAM RULES: You can specify a set of steps for
the browser to follow (like a recipe),
which allows it to access or change the
content of a page
1. REACT TO EVENTS : You can specify that a script should run
when a specific event has occurred. 
** A script is a series of instructions that a
computer can follow to achieve a goal. **
# WRITING A SCRIPT
To write a script, you need to first
state your goal and then list the
tasks that need to be completed in
order to achieve it
## To approach writing a script, break down your goal into
a series of tasks and then work out each step needed
to complete that task (a flowchart can help). 
 * Scripts contain very precise instructions. For example,
you might specify that a value must be remembered
before creating a calculation using that value.
Variables are used to temporarily store pieces of
information used in the script.
Arrays are special types of variables that store more
than one piece of related information.
JavaScript distinguishes between numbers (0-9),
strings (text), and Boolean values (true or false).
Expressions evaluate into a single value.
Expressions rely on operators to calculate a value. 
# functions , methods and objects
* Functions allow you to group a set of related
statements together that represent a single task.
Functions can take parameters (informatiorJ required
to do their job) and may return a value.
An object is a series of variables and functions that
represent something from the world around you.
In an object, variables are known as properties of the
object; functions are known as methods of the object.
Web browsers implement objects that represent both
the browser window and the document loaded into the
browser window.
JavaScript also has several built-in objects such as
String, Number, Math, and Date. Their properties and
methods offer functionality that help you write scripts.
Arrays and objects can be used to create complex data
sets (and both can contain the other).
